# 🔁 P2P File Sharing System

A lightweight yet powerful **peer-to-peer file sharing system** built using **Python** and basic file handling principles. This system supports seamless transfer of virtually **any file type** — `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.exe`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, and more — between multiple clients through a single server over a **shared Wi-Fi or mobile hotspot connection**.

For ease of use, the interface has been crafted using Python’s built-in **`tkinter`** module, allowing for a clean and user-friendly experience without external UI dependencies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone/download both the server and client Python files.
2. Run them on your local system — or across two separate devices connected to the same network.
3. Transfer files effortlessly between devices!

> ✅ **Tip:** Keep the port number as `8080` (default). Only change it if you know what you're doing.  
> 📶 **Ensure** both devices are on the same Wi-Fi/hotspot for successful file transfer.
